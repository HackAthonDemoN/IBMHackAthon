# Project Overview


This project is for Tweet analysis based on cognitive computing using IBM Bluemix's Natural Language Processing API.

The project is implemented through NODE RED.

The application can be initialized with a twitter handle or hashtag. It reads each tweet with the given hashtag or handle and passes it through the natural language classifier or sentiment analysis tool(based on choice), and counts the number of positive or negative tweets on the subject.

This application can be used to analyse the peoples reaction on a particular topic and evaluate the general opinion of the crowd.

Further development can be done by providing a website where users can input the hashtag or twitter handle of their choice and can retreive data in raw or graphical format. (This was planned but could not be currently implemented due to lack of technical knowledge).
